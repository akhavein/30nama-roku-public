# Store readiness: implementation vs proof

## Implemented in the development branch

- Short-lived, revocable, account-bound gateway credentials; isolated progress ownership, bounded enrollment/session/rate/concurrency handling. No shared household key in the public client. Automatic renewal and bounded reauthentication after gateway expiry/restart.
- Cold and warm Roku deep-link dispatch; validated catalog identities, movie/exact episode/series bookmark/season behavior, login handoff, cancellation and invalid-link fallback. The mapping is documented in DEVICE_ACCEPTANCE.md.
- Roku Event Dispatcher authenticated event after a verified profile, launch-completion and login-dialog beacons; Home Back exits without a sidebar detour.
- FF/Rewind enters confirm/cancel scene seeking; Instant Replay intervals constrained to 10–25 seconds.
- Initial global custom-caption integration for On/Off, Instant Replay, Roku TV mute resolution, text size, color and opacity. No silent global Off on loading a sidecar or stale global-mode restore on exit.
- Sign-out/account switch clears account-associated local viewing data; explicit clear action explains that provider-side history is separate. Preferences remain device-local.
- Original unofficial icon/splash assets, build-time artwork validation, listing copy and privacy/terms drafts.

## Not yet completed / must not be reported as passed

- Gateway production endpoint/deployment, live multi-account provider validation, provider/browser compatibility with cookie omission, measured public load and monitoring. Protective caps are not capacity proof.
- Dashboard authenticated access, publisher contact/region/rating details, final policy hosting and the app's reviewed existing-subscriber classification. A developer account exists per the owner; access has not been verified in this session.
- All native checks on this exact changed artifact. Existing private precursor results do not cover these changes. The household TV has not been touched.
- Full catalog trick-play coverage: the current worker supports only its documented HLS subset. Unsupported streams still fall back to time-only seeking. This is not a blanket certification exception.
- Full custom-caption font/edge/window styling and native/custom-track interaction, screen-reader and audio-description checks. The implemented subset is not an accessibility certification claim.
- Genuine current-device screenshots, physical audio/video/lip-sync, final candidate package replacement/resume, multi-device/performance-model checks, Dashboard Static Analysis/App Behavior Analysis and Roku review.
- Actual Store upload, signing/package identity configuration and publication. No terms or rights declarations have been accepted on the publisher's behalf.

## Inputs/actions needed to finish

- Publisher signs in securely to developer.roku.com; no password/OTP in chat.
- Select public support contact and distribution territories/age classification, then finalize policies with actual deployment facts.
- Make an idle test Roku available; additional required hardware or Roku testing access remains necessary.
- Verify provider-supported preview formats/source coverage, and complete native caption work before a public certification claim.
